# description

vg is a toolkit for variation graph data structures, interchange formats, alignment, genotyping, and variant calling methods.

For more in-depth explanations of tools and workflows, see the [vg wiki page](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki).

# synopsis
This is an incomplete list of vg subcommands. For a complete list, run `vg help`.

- **Working with read alignments**
    - [`vg gamsort`](#gamsort): sort a GAM/GAF file or index a sorted GAM file.
    - [`vg filter`](#filter): filter alignments by properties.
    - [`vg surject`](#surject): project alignments on a graph onto a linear reference (gam/gaf->bam/sam/cram).
    - [`vg inject`](#inject): project alignments on a linear reference onto a graph (bam/sam/cram->gam/gaf).
    - [`vg sim`](#sim): simulate reads from a graph. [wiki page](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki/Simulating-reads-with-vg-sim)
- **Graph and read statistics**
    - [`vg stats`](#stats): get stats about the graph.
    - [`vg paths`](#paths): get stats about the paths. [wiki page](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki/Path-Metadata-Model)
    - [`vg gbwt`](#gbwt): get stats about a GBWT.
    - [`vg filter`](#filter): get stats about alignments (use `--tsv-out`).
- **Manipulating a graph**
    - [`vg mod`](#mod): filter, transform, and edit the graph.
    - [`vg prune`](#prune): prune the graph for GCSA2 indexing.
    - [`vg ids`](#ids): manipulate graph node ids.
    - [`vg paths`](#paths): manipulate paths in a graph.

- **Conversion between formats**
    - [`vg convert`](#convert): convert between handle graph formats and GFA, and between alignment formats.
    - [`vg view`](#view): convert between non-handle graph formats and alignment formats (dot, json, turtle...).
