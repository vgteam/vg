 *
 * Assumes that the snarls in the chains we get are in the order they
 * occur in the graph.
 *
 * We adapt the handle graph abstraction as follows:
 *
 * A chain becomes a single node with the ID and local forward orientation
 * of its first snarl's start.
 *
 * A chain node connects on its left to everything connected to its first
 * start and on its right to everything connected to its last end.
 *
 * A unary snarl becomes a single node, too. It is identified by its
 * boundary node's ID.
 *
 * If you're not using internal connectivity, a chain node or a unary snarl
 * node behaves just like an ordinary node.
 *
 * If you are using internal connectivity, edges are slightly faked:
 *
 * A chain node also sees out its right everything that is out its left if
 * it has a left-left connected snarl before any disconnected snarl.
 *
 * And similarly for the mirror case.
 *
 * All the edges on either side of a unary snarl node are the same.
 *
 * In this part of the code we talk about "heads" (the inward-facing base
 * graph handles used to represent child snarls/chains), and "tails" (the
 * inward-facing ending handles of child chains).
