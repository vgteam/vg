/**
 * An index for a node-ID-sorted VPKG-formatted Protobuf file, such as GAM or VG.
 *
 * Works on a BAI-like concept of bins partitioning node ID space.
 *
 * Files are serialized as count-prefixed groups of Protobuf messages. These
 * groups are the smallest unit that can be deserialized.
 *
 * Every *group* of messages gets assigned to a bin which is the longest bin
 * that completely contains the ID range used in the group.
 *
 * We define *runs* of adjacent groups which have the same bin, which are the
 * basic subject of the index.
 *
 * We then store an index from bin to the virtual offset ranges (start and
 * past-the-end), in order, of runs that are assigned to the bin.
 *
 * You will get non-contiguous virtual offset ranges for a node ID range when
 * some messages run into the range from the left, then messages that start
 * later don't, and then messages that start even later do again.
 *
 * We also have a BAI-style linear index, mapping from tiling windows in node
 * ID space to the lowest virtual offset of a group that overlaps the window.
 *
 * The bin structure is that we partition all of node ID space into bins of
 * power-of-2 size, starting with size 2 nodes. We number the bins such that 0
 * is the whole-ID-space bin, divided into 1 and 2, then into 3, 4, 5, and 6,
 * then into 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and so on.
 *
 * The tiling windows are just the node IDs down-shifted by a few bits.
 *
 * Messages that use no nodes (i.e. unmapped reads) are considered to visit
 * node ID 0. The maximum and minimum id_t values are used as sentinels, so
 * they can't be real nodes.
 *
 * All find operations are thread-safe with respect to each other. Simultaneous
 * adds or finds and adds are prohibited.
 *
 * Most of the basic index API doesn't depend on the message type. So we put it
 * in this base class and inherit form it in templates that provide the
 * high-level interface in terms of message instances.
