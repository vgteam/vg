/**
 * SnarlDistanceIndexClusterer is used for clustering seeds (positions on the graph)
 * A "cluster" is a partition of seeds that is based on the minimum distance between them in the graph
 * Consider a graph where each seed is a node and two seeds are connected if the minimum distance
 * between them is smaller than a given distance limit. Each connected component of this graph is a cluster 
 *
 * The clustering algorithm is based on the snarl tree
 * Clusters are formed on nodes of the snarl tree, which represent nodes/snarls/chains
 * Each node/snarl/chain represents a subgraph of the variation graph
 * A clustered snarl tree node contains all seeds that occur on its subgraph, and the seeds have been partitioned into clusters
 * Each cluster knows the shortest distance from any seed it contains to both ends of the snarl tree node containing it
 * Clustering is done progressively by walking up the snarl tree and forming clusters on each snarl tree node (only visiting nodes that have seeds on them)
 * At each snarl tree node, assume that its children have already been clustered. 
 * The clusters of the children are compared to each other, and any pair that are close enough 
 * are combined to produce clusters on the parent 
 * The distances from each cluster to the ends of the parent are updated
 *
 * The algorithm starts by assigning each seed to its node on the snarl tree
 * Since nodes are all on chains, this fills in all the children of chains that are nodes
 * It then walks up the snarl tree, level by level, and clusters each snarl tree node that contains seeds
 * At a given level, first cluster each chain in the level. After clustering a chain, assign it 
 * to its parent snarl. Then, go through each of the snarls that have just been given children, and
 * cluster the snarls. Each snarl then gets assigned to its parent chain
 * This completes one level of the snarl tree. Each chain in the next level has just been populated by the snarls
 * from this level, and already knew about its nodes from the first step, so it is ready to be clustered 
 *
 * Every time the clusterer is run, a ClusteringProblem is made to store information about the state of the clusterer
 * The ClusteringProblem keeps track of which level of the snarl tree is currently being clustered, and
 * keeps track of the children of the current and next level of the snarl tree. 
 * Each snarl tree node that contains seeds is represented by a SnarlTreeNodeProblem.
 * The SnarlTreeNodeProblem represents the problem of clustering one snarl tree node. 
 * It knows the identities of its children and keeps track of its cluster heads
 *
