/** \file
 * subcommand.hpp: defines a system for registering subcommands of the vg
 * command (vg construct, vg view, etc.) at compile time. Replaces the system of
 * defining two functions and a giant run of if statements in main.cpp.
 *
 * main.cpp does *not* need to include any subcommand headers!
 *
 * Subcommands are created as static global objects in their own compilation
 * units, which have to be explicitly linked into the binary (they won't be
 * pulled out of a library if nothing references their symbols).
 *
 * Subcommands are responsible for printing their own help; we can do "vg help"
 * and print all the subcommands that exist (via a help subcommand), but we
 * can't do "vg help subcommand" and have that be equivalent to "vg subcommand
 * --help" (because the help subcommand doesn't know how to get help info on the
 * others).
 *
 * We have a subcommand importance/category system, so we can tell people about
 * just the main pipeline and keep the subcommands they don't want out of their
 * brains and off their screen.
 *
 * Subcommands get passed all of argv, so they have to skip past their names
 * when parsing arguments.
 *
 * To make a subcommand, do something like this in a *_main.cpp file in this
 * "subcommand" directory:
 * 
 *     #include "subcommand.hpp"
 *     using namespace vg::subcommand;
 * 
 *     int main_frobnicate(int argc, char** argv) {
 *         return 0;
 *     }
 *
 *     static Subcommand vg_frobnicate("frobnicate", "frobnicate nodes and edges",
 *         main_frobnicate);
 * 
 * All src/subcommand/*_main.cpp files must pass the checks (formatting etc.) in
 * scripts/check_options.py as part of an automated test.
