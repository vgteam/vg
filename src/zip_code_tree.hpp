/**

A ZipCodeTree represents of set of SnarlDistanceIndexCluserer::Seed's (seed alignments between a 
read and reference) as a tree structure.
The tree represents the connectivity of the seeds, based on the distance index.
Edges are labelled with distance values.
The tree can be traversed to find distances between seeds

This provides an iterator that, given a seed and a distance limit, iterates through seeds that are
reachable within the distance limit

The ZipCodeTree is built by the ZipCodeForest, which represents a collection of trees

*/
class ZipCodeTree {

    typedef SnarlDistanceIndexClusterer::Seed Seed;

    public:

    /// Empty constructor
    /// ZipCodeTree's get filled in by ZipCodeForest's
    ZipCodeTree(){};

    /*
      The tree will represent the seeds' placement in the snarl tree.
      Each node in the tree represents either a seed (position on the graph, representing the start
      of an alignment) or the boundary of a snarl or chain.
      Edges are labelled with the distance between the two nodes

      This graph is actually represented as a vector of the nodes and edges
      Each item in the vector represents either a node (seed or boundary), an edge (distance),
      or the child count of a snarl

      A chain in the vector is bounded by a CHAIN_START and a CHAIN_END.
      The chain is comprised of alternating children (seed or snarl) and the distances between them,
      starting and ending with a child. The order would be:
        CHAIN_START, child, distance, child, distance, ..., child, CHAIN_END
      The distance from the chain start to the first child is included in the distances in the 
      chain's parent snarl, if relevant

      The distances represent the number of nucleotides on the minimum-length path in the variation 
      graph between the structures that the zip code tree nodes represent.
      Seeds represent the first nucleotide of the alignment, so when the seed is traversed forwards
      in the zip tree, the distance starting from that seed includes the position. If the seed is 
      reversed in the zip tree, then the distance doesn't include the position
      For two SEEDs on the same position, the distance between them would be 0.
      For chain distances terminating at a SNARL_START or SNARL_END, the distance reaches the inner 
      edge (relative to the snarl) of the boundary node, so it includes the length of the boundary 
      node of the snarl

      For example, given a subgraph of a chain:

                              n3
                            [GACG] ...
            n1      n2    / 
            [A] - [AGAC]
                          \   n4
                            [ACAG] ...

      for the sequence "SEED EDGE SNARL_START" representing a seed on n1 and the snarl starting at 
      n2, the edge value would be 5.
      Within the snarl, the edge distances include the distance to the first seed in the chain.
      For a seed at position node 3 +1 (the A oriented forwards), the sequence would be
      "SNARL_START EDGE CHAIN_START SEED", and the edge value would be 1


      A snarl in the vector is bounded by a SNARL_START and a SNARL_END.
      A snarl is comprised of the two bounds, one or more chains, and the distances among them.
      SEEDs are always contained within a chain.
      For each element of the snarl (boundary or child chain), the distance to each element 
      preceding it in the snarl is stored before the element.
      The distances are stored in reverse order of the elements that they reach.
      Immediately before the SNARL_END, there is a NODE_COUNT storing the number of children in the
      snarl. A snarl would look like:
          SNARL_START, dist:start->c1, chain1, dist:c1->c2, dist:start->c2, chain2, ..., 
                ..., dist:c2->end, dist:c1->end, dist:start->end, node_count, SNARL_END

      For snarls that aren't dags (called cyclic snarls, even though they could have an inversion 
      and no cycles), the zip tree should represent all possible paths that the read could take 
      through the snarl. All seeds on the snarl are split up into "runs" of seeds on the same chain
      that are "close" to each other. The runs are sorted and orientated by their read coordinate 
      and each run is made into a separate child chain like normal. A run may occur twice, once in 
      each orientation. See get_cyclic_snarl_intervals() for details 


      Everything is ordered according to the order of the highest-level chain (top-level chain or 
      child of a top-level snarl).
      For children of a snarl, the children are ordered according to a topological sort of the 
      snarl. In the variation graph, all chains are considered to be oriented "forward" in their 
      parent snarl. However, in a start-to-end traversal of the snarl, the child chain may be 
      traversed end-to-start. These chains would be considered to be reversed in the zip code tree,
      so the order of the children of the chain may be backwards relative to their order in the 
      variation graph. If a snarl is the child of a chain that is traversed backwards in the zip 
      tree, then that snarl and all its children are also traversed backwards.

    /***********************************************************************************************

      Data structures and helper functions for construction

      **********************************************************************************************

      Construction is done in a depth-first traversal of the snarl tree. So when each 
      snarl tree node is visited, the start of the structure is added to the zip tree, then each of
      its children is added to the zip tree along with the distances between them, then the end of
      the structure is added.
      
      The traversal of the snarl tree is accomplished by progressively sorting the seeds to identify
      the snarl tree structures that they lie on. Using the zip codes, the seeds can be sorted on 
      each snarl tree structure separately. Seeds along a chain are sorted to be ordered along a 
      chain, and seeds in a snarl are sorted by the child of the snarl that they are on. The seeds 
      get sorted using a radix-like sort on each structure at each depth of the snarl tree, starting
      with the root and moving down. 
      "Intervals" of seeds in the sort order are used to keep track of the location on the snarl 
      tree. An interval represents a range of seeds that are all on the same snarl tree structure.
      After sorting an interval at one depth, sub-intervals representing the children can be found.
      So first, the seeds are sorted into connected components and sliced into intervals 
      representing root-level snarls and chains. Each interval is then sorted to order the seeds
      along the snarl or chain, and new intervals are found representing ranges of seeds on the 
      children.

      Sorting and tree-building are done at the same time, progressively at each structure in the
      snarl tree. The order of tree-building is based on a stack of intervals. The algorithm starts 
      with an interval for each child of the root snarl. An interval is popped from the stack. Any 
      incomplete snarls or chains that the interval is not a child of must be completed. Then, the
      snarl or chain that the interval represents is started in the zip tree, and any relevant 
      distances are added. Intervals representing the children of the snarl or chain are found and
      added to the stack. This repeats until the stack is empty.

      Each snarl and chain in the zip code tree is comprised of the start and end bounds, the 
      children, and distances between children/bounds. So as each child is added, we will need
      to know what came before it in the parent snarl/chain so that we can add the distances. We 
      also need to remember the ancestors of each snarl and chain as we are building them, so that
      we can close each structure properly. All of this information is stored in a 
      forest_growing_state_t as the zip trees are being built.
