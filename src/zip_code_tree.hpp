/*

A ZipCodeTree represents of set of SnarlDistanceIndexCluserer::Seed's
(seed alignments between a read and reference) as a tree structure.
The tree represents the connectivity of the seeds, based on the distance index.
Edges are labelled with distance values.

Two iterators are provided:
- A seed_iterator yields seeds in the tree, in left-to-right order
- A distance_iterator yields seeds within a given distance limit
reachable from a given seed, traversing the tree with a given initial direction

A ZipCodeForest, which represents a collection of trees, builds ZipCodeTree's
via its fill_in_forest(), which accepts a vector of seeds, a graph's distance
index, and an optional distance limit. This is meant to be called using the
seeds found in a read.

Main developers:
- Xian Chang (@xchang1)
- Adam Novak (@adamnovak): distance iterator
- Faith Okamoto (@faithokamoto): modifications for better cyclic snarl handing

    /// Convenient alias for SnarlDistanceIndexClusterer::Seed
    /// Despite the name, these are used for graph positions,
    /// so they act more like minimizers
    typedef SnarlDistanceIndexClusterer::Seed Seed;

    /*
      The tree will represent the seeds' placement in the snarl tree.
      Each node in the tree represents either a seed (position on the graph,
      for the start of an alignment) or the boundary of a snarl or chain.
      Edges are labelled with the distance between the two nodes

      This graph is actually represented as a vector of the nodes and edges
      Each item in the vector represents either a node (seed or boundary),
      an edge (distance), or the child count of a snarl

      ---- CHAINS ----

      A chain in the vector is bounded by a CHAIN_START and a CHAIN_END.
      A chain is comprised of alternating children (seed or snarl) and the
      distances between them, starting and ending with a child. The order is:
        CHAIN_START, child, distance, child, distance, ..., child, CHAIN_END
      The distance from the chain start to the first child is
      included in the distances in the chain's parent snarl, if relevant

      The distances represent the number of nucleotides on the minimum-length
      path in the variation graph between the structures that the zip code tree
      nodes represent. For edges within a chain, offsets are queried from the
      seeds' zipcodes.

      Seeds represent the first nucleotide of the alignment. When a seed is
      traversed forwards in the zip tree (get_is_reversed() is false), distancea
      starting from that seed includes the position. If the seed is reversed in
      the zip tree, then distances doesn't include the position.

      For two SEEDs on the same position, the distance between them would be 0.
      As a convenience, such edges are omitted; the tree will have [seed seed]
      For chain distances terminating at a snarl bound, the distance reaches the
      inner edge (relative to the snarl) of the boundary node,
      so it includes the length of the boundary node of the snarl

      For example, given a subgraph of a chain:

                              n3
                            [GACG] ...
            n1      n2    / 
            [A] - [AGAC]
                          \   n4
                            [ACAG] ...

      for the sequence "SEED EDGE SNARL_START" representing a seed on n1
      and the snarl starting at n2, the edge value would be 5
      Within the snarl, edges include the distance to the first seed in a chain.
      For a seed at position node 3 +1 (the A oriented forwards), the distance
      matrix would store an edge value of 1 for the distance between the
      SNARL_START and that chain

      ---- SNARLS ----

      A snarl in the vector is bounded by a SNARL_START and a SNARL_END.
      A snarl is comprised of the two bounds, one or more chains,
      and the distances among them. SEEDs are always contained within a chain.
      Immediately after the SNARL_START, there is a CHAIN_COUNT, then the lower
      triangle of a distance matrix made using distance_in_snarl(). Distances
      are always FROM the right side of a chain/bound TO the left side.
      A DAG snarl with two chains would look like:
          SNARL_START, CHAIN_COUNT, dist:start->c1, dist:start->c2,
                dist:c1->c2, dist:start->end, dist:c1->end, dist:c2->end,
                chain1, chain2, SNARL_END

      For snarls that aren't DAGs (called cyclic snarls, though they could have
      an inversion and no cycles), distances are stored to either end of each
      chain. Self-loops are included. Self-loops for chain bounds are stored as
      inf to keep the triangle shape but are never used.
      A cyclic snarl with one chain would look like:
          SNARL_START, CHAIN_COUNT, inf, dist:start->c1_L,
                dist:c1_L->c1_L, dist:start->c1_R, dist:c1_L->c1_R,
                dist:c1_R->c1_R, dist:start->end, dist:c1_L->end,
                dist:c1_R->end, inf, chain1, SNARL_END
    
      ---- ORDERING ----

      Everything is ordered according to the order of the highest-level chain
      (top-level chain or child of a top-level snarl).
      Children of a snarl are ordered by a topological sort of the snarl.

      In the variation graph, all chains are considered to be oriented "forward"
      in their parent snarl. However, in a start-to-end traversal of the snarl,
      the child chain may be traversed end-to-start. These chains are considered
      to be reversed in the zip code tree, so the order of the children of the
      chain may be backwards relative to their order in the variation graph.
      If a snarl is the child of a chain that is traversed backwards in the zip 
      tree, then that snarl and all its children are also traversed backwards.

     * Iterator that visits seeds left to right in the tree's in-order traversal

     * ## Iteration flow
     * 
     * Each seed is visited from left to right, in the same order as

     * 
     * The first time any given seed is visited, right_to_left is true,

     * default direction of right to left.
     * 
     * Once the right-to-left step has been done, then the iterator
     * decides whether to do a second, left-to-right step, with
     * right_to_left set to false. This will happen if inside a cyclic snarl,
     * even if not necessarily the direct parent. Calling ++() will 
     * toggle right_to_left instead of moving the internal iteration index.
     * The next call to ++() would then reset right_to_left back to true,
     * and finally advance the iterator rightward to the next seed.
     * 
     * For seeds not inside cyclic snarls, ++() will simply move rightward.
     * 
     * We need to traverse seeds in cyclic snarls in both directions because

     * to iterate over a zip tree with cyclic and non-cyclic snarls. All a
     * caller needs to do is
     * - call ++() to move to the next seed
     * - dereference the iterator to get the seeds at the current position
     * - create the distance iterator for this position by calling
     *   find_distances(seed_itr, distance_limit)
     * 
     * Seeds from both iterators will be automatically oriented based on the
     * direction of traversal. That is, you can Just Trust Me (TM) for all seed
     * orientations which iterators yield.

    /***************************************************************************

      Data structures and helper functions for construction

      **************************************************************************

      Construction is done in a depth-first traversal of the snarl tree.
      When each snarl tree node is visited, the start of the structure is added
      to the zip tree, then each of its children is added to the zip tree along
      with the distances between them, then the end of the structure is added.
      
      The traversal is accomplished by progressively sorting the seeds to
      identify the snarl tree structures that they lie on. Using the zip codes,
      the seeds can be sorted on each snarl tree structure separately. Seeds
      along a chain are sorted to be ordered along a chain, and seeds in a snarl
      are sorted by the child of the snarl that they are on. The seeds get
      sorted using a radix-like sort on each structure at each depth of the
      snarl tree, starting with the root and moving down. 

      "Intervals" of seeds in the sort order are used to keep track of the
      location on the snarl tree. An interval represents a range of seeds that
      are all on the same snarl tree structure. After sorting an interval at one
      depth, sub-intervals representing the children can be found. So first, the
      seeds are sorted into connected components and sliced into intervals 
      representing root-level snarls and chains. Each interval is then sorted to
      order the seeds along the snarl or chain, and new intervals are found
      representing ranges of seeds on the children.

      Sorting and tree-building are done at the same time, progressively at each
      structure in the snarl tree. The order of tree-building is based on a
      stack of intervals. The algorithm starts with an interval for each child
      of the root snarl. An interval is popped from the stack. Any incomplete
      snarls or chains that the interval is not a child of must be completed.
      Then, the snarl or chain that the interval represents is started in the
      zip tree, and any relevant distances are added. Intervals representing the
      children of the snarl or chain are found and added to the stack.
      
      This repeats until the stack is empty.

      Each snarl/chain in the zip code tree is comprised of start/end bounds,
      its children, and distances between children/bounds. So as each child is
      added, we will need to know what came before it in the parent snarl/chain
      so that we can add the distances. We also need to remember the ancestors
      of each snarl and chain as we are building them, so that we can close each
      structure properly. This information is stored in a forest_growing_state_t
      as the zip trees are being built.
