 *
 * To use these algorithms, decide on the type (Anchor) you want to chain up.
 *
 * Then, make a dynamic programming table: vector<TracedScore>.
 *
 * Then, call chain_items_dp() to fill in the dynamic programming table and get
 * the score of the best chain.
 *
 * You can use chain_items_traceback() to get a traceback of the chain's items
 * in order.
 *
 * Helper entry points are find_best_chain() and score_best_chain() which set
 * up the DP for you and do the traceback if appropriate.
